# lab-container-api
Service / API to automate creating Docker containers for online tutorials and labs.

Essentially we want to provide a service / API framework to quickly spin up working environments or run some app process coinciding with a Coursera, CodeAcademy, etc. type tutorial.

## Phase 1: Discovery
- look at what's currenlty available / see if people have already done it
- if they have, is it open source? and is there a meaningful, different way to do it? is there room for improvement?
